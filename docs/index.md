# Interloper: the ultra-portable data asset framework

Interloper is an open-source Python data asset framework that makes defining, managing, and materializing data assets effortless. Inspired by modern tools and frameworks like Dagster and DLT, it blends:

* The lightweight flexibility of a python library – Simple, schema-aware pipelines with quick iteration.  
* The asset-oriented mindset of Dagster – Structured, declarative data assets with flexible IO-based materialization.

With Interloper, your data lake is an asset graph, not a mess of tables. Define your assets, decide where they land, and materialize data your way.
