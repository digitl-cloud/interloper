# FAQ

### Why another data framework?

Because the existing ones are either too opinionated, too bloated, or just donâ€™t get out of your way.

* ETL tools force rigid workflows.
* Orchestration frameworks overcomplicate simple jobs.
* DIY pipelines break the moment your schema changes.

Interloper sits in between:

* **Simple when you want it**: write a function, materialize an asset.
* **Powerful when you need it**: define dependencies, automatically reconcile schemas, partitioning and backfill strategies, etc.
